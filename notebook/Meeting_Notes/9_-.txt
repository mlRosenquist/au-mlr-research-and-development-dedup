===== Agenda =====

==== What I have looked at: ====
[ ] Look at 3-4 different outlier data sets. Dont do timing. But get metrics for each in nice table. 
	[ ] Decide datasets- 
	[ ] sklearn extention work on more dimensions
	[ ] implement way to compare metrics from multiple datasets. Or make multiple notebooks and manually create table. 

[*] Make a deviation/metrics plot on the synthetic data set.
	[*] Make the setup. Tune deviation bits
	[*] Make plot

[ ] Figure to show extended is to be drawn by hand, see google example.  and maybe trees beside. 
	[ ] Decide simple example
	[ ] Figure with cuts - original, bases, extended
	[ ] Figure with trees - original bases, extended

==== What I have not looked at: ====

==== Questions: ====
- What can we see from deviation metric plot 

==== Notes ====
