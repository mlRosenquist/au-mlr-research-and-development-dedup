===== Agenda =====

==== What I have looked at: ====
* Read articles: 
	* Direct Analytics on Gen. Dedup compressed data
	* Isolation Forest
* Looked at anomaly detection methods
* Looked at axel's code.
* Looked at Isolation Forest improvements

==== Questions: ====
* Which anomaly detection method to use?:
	* Maybe try different ones and evaluate result. 
		* Isolation Forest
		* Extended Isolation Forest? h2o library 
		* Distance based?
		* Amazon's Random Cut Forest? Is an open source version

* More concrete how to do the anomaly detection on gen dedup compressed data:
	* Look at the basis?
	* Look at the deviation?
	* Integers/Float32/Floatxx

* Axel used a python.gd library. How to get that? Is it the one from aaron?

==== Next Steps: ====

Anomaly detection datasets
