===== Agenda =====

==== What I have looked at: ====
[*] Understand axel's setup and code
[*] Setup source code
[*] Generate GD data
[*] Perform isolation forest on gd data
[*] Look at scikit learn implementation
[*] Look at other implementations of iForest
[*] Looked at other anomaly detections methods. 

==== Questions: ====

* Which dataset to work on
	* Which features to look at: 2/3/4
	* Two features
	* Done GD on both features?
	* What about the deviation? 
		* Only looking at the base. Not so import for approximate analytics. 
	* IOT data
* Scikit learn isolation forest
	* Not much configurability
	* We talked about looking at bins - how exactly?
	* Should I create my own implementation
* What to measure and test?

==== Next Steps: ====
- Look at data sets. 
	-  

(0001, 0010) -> base: (00,00) - deviation: (01,10)
(0011, 0011) -> base: (00,00) - deviation: (11,11)
(0101, 0110)  -> base: (01,01) - deviation: (01,10)
{{./pasted_image.png}}can calculate h(x) backwards from anomaly score from scikit learn. 

if certain counts of x then we can do. Assumptions of how deep we can cut. Simplify way to compute that. 
Think about scalin. A lot of it goes to maximum depth. 

What are results of both 

How is the isolation forest. 

How many samples are we clustering where. 

2,3,4 features. 

100 samples.
