===== Agenda =====

==== What I have looked at: ====
[*] Understand axel's setup and code
[*] Setup source code
[*] Generate GD data
[*] Perform isolation forest on gd data
[*] Look at scikit learn implementation
[*] Look at other implementations of iForest
[*] Looked at other anomaly detections methods. 

==== Questions: ====
* Which dataset to work on
	* Which features to look at
	* Two features
	* Done GD on both features?
	* What about the deviation?
	* IOT data
* Scikit learn isolation forest
	* Not much configurability
	* We talked about looking at bins - how?
	* Should I create my own implementation
* What to measure and test?

==== Next Steps: ====
