Created Tuesday 22 March 2022

===== Agenda =====

==== What I have looked at: ====
- Synthetic data set
	- 2 features
- Calculations

==== Questions: ====
clarification on calculation. 
	- n = amount of bases in our situation. How do i count these? I'm working on 2d set. So is it the count (x,y), where x and y is each a base. (n_base)
	- H(i) - should be okay
	- c(n) - relies on n
	- where does x come from in equation 1

==== Notes ====

====== Next Steps: ======
- perform the calculation - look at pictures
- look into comparing isolation - with and without generalized deduplication. Performance and how well they detect outliers. 
- look into sklearn and h ow they get the negative values.
