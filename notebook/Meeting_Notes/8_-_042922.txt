===== Agenda =====

==== What I have looked at: ====
- look further sklearn implementation
	- works
	- optimized
	- not on my work pc :(

- performance: 
	- accuracy, precision, recall, f1
	- computation - ? 
		-  will have to look deeper into the algorithm, and define pseudo algorithm
	- confusion matrix
	- timing experiments

- Figure to illustrate different decisions functions
	- Is nice for report, when describing extended version. But how should it look. Inspiration: https://www.google.com/search?q=isolation+forest+figure&rlz=1C1GCEU_enDK897DK897&sxsrf=ALiCzsbedY0AvgOIcymROTaikk736aIRaw:1651161215405&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjb7tftjrf3AhXC0aQKHVLKDYwQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=956&bih=920&dpr=1
	- Got decision function example in notebook, with a single cluster 
	
- Start on report 
	- Thought about structure. 
	- Looked into similar topics on how they structure the papers. 
	- Not 100% sure in what to include

==== What I have not looked at: ====


==== Questions: ====
- Go through report structure

==== Notes ====

====== Next Steps: ======
