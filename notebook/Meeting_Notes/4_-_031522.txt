===== Agenda =====

==== What I have looked at: ====
[ ] Looked at anomolay data sets
[ ] Performed isolation forest on different dimensions

==== Questions: ====

* Dataset
	* All the datasets have multiple features
		* Will get bad performance when using less features? Should i do some feature selection or dimension reduction?
			* Possibly PCA & LDA. 
			* Also look into feature reduction techniques. 

* I have the anomaly score. Why is it relevant to calculate as per the formula in the paper. 
* {{./pasted_image.png}}can calculate h(x) backwards from anomaly score from scikit learn. 

if certain counts of x then we can do. Assumptions of how deep we can cut. Simplify way to compute that. 
Think about scalin. A lot of it goes to maximum depth. 

==== Next Steps: ====

n = number of bases
might need to scale = 

{{./pasted_image002.png}}
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
{{./pasted_image004.png}}
extract h(x). 

Do it on syntehtic data set.
