====== Direct Analytics of Generalized Deduplication Compressed IoT Data ======
Created Monday 14 February 2022

- Analytics on compressed data
- TRISTAN/Plato on time series data - lossy
- Zwift and Alacrity - lossless (less and slow compression)
- GD - lossless, suits IoT, random Access
- Main Contributions: 
	1) Efficient compressed data analytics methods for numeric data based on a lossless compression algorithm,
	2) Experimental validation of these methods in the context of clustering, including explainable clustering, and 
	3) Insights into key challenges of direct compressed data analytics and considerations for managing compression and analytics holistically.
- Focuses on clustering and testing k-means. And two explainable variation: IMM and DTC. 
- Base centroid: mean of minimum and maximum -> mapped to base. 
- Maximum deviation: their difference.

==== Results ====
GD Modifications: 
- Storing d in the parameters file to avoid building in assumptions to determine the number of attributes.
- Restricting the sign and exponent bits to the base for floating point data.
Procedure: 
- clustering: k-means / IMM [[/DTC]]
- measure cluster performance with sum of squared errors
- compared with approximation ratio

==== Conclusion ====
- Direct analysis on lossless compressed data. 
- Approximated uncompressed with only 1-5% difference, only acessing 14% as much data. Quarter of a time. Storage saving of 53.6%
- Future work: outlier detection, classification and basic queries.
