====== Isolation Forest ======


==== Introduction ====

=== Anomaly: ===
Different data characteristics from normal instances. 

=== Anomaly Detection ===

=== Isolation Forest ===
- Model based method
- Isolates anomalies instead of profiling normal instances
- properties: 
	i) they are the minority consisting of fewer instances and
	ii) they have attribute-values that are very different from those of normal instances
- Anomalies isolated closer to the root of the tree. 
- procedure: 
	- build iTrees
	- anomalies are the ones with short average path

===== Characteristis of Isolation Trees =====
Both swamping and masking are a result of too many data for the purpose of anomaly detections. 
Isolation Forest allows sub-sampling to avoid this. 

==== Swamping ====
Wrong identifying normal instances as anomalies.

==== Masking ====
Too many anomalies concealing their own presence. For example anomaly clusters. 

==== Mulcross ====

===== Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest =====
- Two-stage process

==== Training: ====
	- build isolation trees using sub-saples of training set
	- recursively partition training set untill instances are isolated or height is met.

==== Testing ====
	- passes test instances through tree to obtain anomaly score
