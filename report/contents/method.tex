\unfinished{write method}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Here we describe how the work was done.
    \item Mathematical description of new model. Maybe pseudocode of algorithm? 
    \item Discussion of new model? Performance, complexicity, etc? 
    \item We describe the extended isolation forest here. In Direct Analysis of GD .. the used method has its own section. 
    \item Concept, and new stuffs
    \item Running isolation as is directly on bases - phase 1
    \item Running extended isolation on the bases  - phase 2
    \item Can include or exclude counts 
    \item tradeoffs: counts, precision. 
\end{itemize}
