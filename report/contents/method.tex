\unfinished{write method}
% Notes: 
% Here we describe how the work was done.
% Mathematical description of new model. Maybe pseudocode of algorithm? 
% Discussion of new model? Performance, complexicity, etc? 
% We describe the extended isolation forest here. In Direct Analysis of GD .. the used method has its own section. 
% Concept, and new stuffs
% Running isolation as is directly on bases - phase 1
% Running extended isolation on the bases  - phase 2
% Can include or exclude counts 
% tradeoffs: counts, precision.

% What to include:
