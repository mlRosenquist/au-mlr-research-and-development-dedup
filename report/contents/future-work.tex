DupRes currently uses the $log_2(x_{count})$ term to tune the score towards being an inlier based on the count. This is potentially a hyperparameter that can be tuned. Maybe a completely different term fits better. This could be something that also includes the dimensionality of the data or other factors. This report looked at a limited amount of datasets. It would therefore be interesting to see how the different models perform on others. In regards to generalized deduplication we only investigated 8 bit integers. Thus, a task is to research the anomaly detection behaviour on floating numbers.
