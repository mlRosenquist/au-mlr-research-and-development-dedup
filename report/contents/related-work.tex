\unfinished{Write related work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Should this be previous/related work?
    \item Does this section make sense
    \item In Direct Analysis of GD... there is a background section describing GD and clustering etc. Should we take that approach?
    \item What to include in this? GD, State of The art Anomaly Detection, Isolation Forest, etc.? 
    \item Background makes sense for GD and Isolation Forest
    \item Related work state of the art
    \item Maybe related work part of introduction
    \item Include both related and background 
\end{itemize}
