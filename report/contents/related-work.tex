Performing analytics on compressed data is not an untouched subject. \\ 

A collection of models and algorithms are developed to perform classification and anomaly detection within network communication on compressed data\cite{related-1}.\\ 

Another paper looks into anomaly detection based on compressed data. They do it on the edge of the cloud on compressed data. Lots of formulas regarding rate vs. distortion. Dont know compression or anomaly detection method\cite{anomaly-det-compressed}. \\ 

Direct analytics on data compressed using generalized deduplication has been carried out. It was studied how clustering(K-Means, IMM, DTC) could be performed on synthetic, synthetic with noise and a power consumption data set \cite{dir-analytics-gd}. \\

Since isolation forest only performs horizontal and vertical splits certain anomalies will not be detected. Imagining a two dimensional data set. Then the ones having the same x and y values might not be isolated correctly. This is extended by allowing diagonal splits in the extended isolation forest\cite{extended-iforest}.
